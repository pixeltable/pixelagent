# Pixelagent: An Agent Engineering Blueprint 🛠️

- **Purpose**: AI engineers need a flexible, simple framework for agent engineering.
- **Solution**: Pixelagent offers automated data orchestration, persistence, low-level LLM access, and multimodal support.
- **How It Works**: Engineer agents using tables.

---

## Why Pixelagent? 🌟

- **Core Idea**: Simplifies agent engineering with Pixeltable’s AI infrastructure. 
- **Key Features**:
  - Automates data orchestration and storage as the foundation.
  - Handles LLM protocols, tool handshakes, and incremental updates—no manual persistence needed.
  - Native multimodal support (text, images, and more).
- **Your Role**: Define tables and columns; Pixeltable does the heavy lifting.
- **Goal**: Empower you to DIY your own agent or framework by plugging together tables and columns.
- **Not Another LLM Framework**: Pixelagent is a data-first framework focused on Agentic workflows. Pixelagent delivers on data orchestration and storage allowing you to focus on the Agent.

## The Blueprint 🗺️

- **Core Components**:
  - LLM API Message Protocol (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Tool-call handshake (call tools, get results)
- **Common Extensions**:
  - Looping (e.g., reflection)
  - Memory (short/long-term)
  - Knowledge (e.g., multimodal RAG)
  - Teams (multi-agent setups)
- **Tools**: Simple Python functions for easy, tailored extensions.

## What Makes Pixelagent Different? ⚡

- **Data-First Philosophy**: Built on Pixeltable's AI infrastructure, providing automated data orchestration and persistence as the foundation.
- **Lean and Focused**: Single dependency (Pixeltable) keeps the framework lightweight while delivering powerful capabilities.
- **Declarative Data Model**: Engineer agents by defining tables and columns—Pixeltable handles the complex orchestration.
- **Native Multimodal**: Built-in support for text, images, and beyond, perfect for advanced use cases like RAG.
- **Simplified Engineering**: Focus on your agent logic while Pixeltable manages:
  - Data persistence and retrieval
  - LLM protocols and tool handshakes
  - Incremental updates and state management
  - Multimodal data handling
